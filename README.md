# osucord-bridge
Links an osu! channel to a Discord channel

Allows Discord users to see all the messages sent in an osu! channel.

It also allows sending messages to osu! directly from Discord by registering your
IRC credentials in the bot using the `!osuirc` command (do this in PM if you don't
want to leak your credentials!!)
